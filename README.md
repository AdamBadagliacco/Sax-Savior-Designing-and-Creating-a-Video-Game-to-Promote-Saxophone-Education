# Sax-Savior-Designing-and-Creating-a-Video-Game-to-Promote-Saxophone-Education

This repository contains the paper and video presentation of my senior year capstone project. The paper contains all research and game documentation. The video is my presentation of my project as well as a demo of the game. 

Abstract:
  Learning to play the saxophone can be difficult and costly. One must pay for the instrument, music lessons, as well as additional supplies. Once this financial bridge is crossed, students must learn basic notes, rhythms, and sight reading before they are able to play written music. This often leaves them discouraged and many quit before they have had the opportunity to experience the full potential of playing the instrument.
  My research aims to answer the question: How can learning saxophone be more affordable, accessible, and engaging? My proposed solution is Sax Savior. 
  Sax Savior is a rhythm-based video game that teaches you to play saxophone. The game controller resembles a saxophone to teach correct muscle memory.  This helps a player transition from playing the game to playing the instrument. Sax Savior allows people to learn the saxophone in a fun and affordable way, opening the skill of playing the saxophone to people of all walks of life.
